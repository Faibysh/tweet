# Tweets

This is a React application that implements the functionality of the Twitter social network. The application consists of a list of tweets that can be filtered by the "follow" or "unfollow" status, and a "Load more" button that allows you to add additional tweets to the page. Each tweet has its own card with an avatar, username, tweet text, and a Follow/Unfollow button.

[pip](https://github.com/<your-username>/tweets.git)
Change to the project folder using the `cd tweets` command.

## Usage

When you start the application, a list of tweets is displayed. Each tweet contains a title, a short description, and a follow and following status. To change the follow or following status, click on the corresponding icon on the tweet.
Above the list of tweets is a filter. You can use the filter to show tweets that have a follow, following, or all tweets.
There is also a pagination option. By default, 3 tweets are displayed per page. To view more tweets, click on the "Load More" button.
